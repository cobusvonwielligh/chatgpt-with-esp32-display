**ChatESP** transforms an ESP32 into a compact, portable AI companion and smart interface. The long-term goal is to develop a full-feature home automation and control interface that can manage sensors, I/O devices, and user interactions via voice, video, or text.

This project aims to evolve into a modular, AI-driven platform with support for IoT devices and I/O interfaces focussed on automation, convenience and companionship.

ChatESP should eventually be able to support:

- Audio and video input for prompt generation
- IoT control via Home Assistant integration
- Voice or text-based interaction
- Smart lighting responses based on ambient brightness
- Weather and alert monitoring
- Spoken responses from ChatGPT

<h4>Use cases include:</h4>

- Smart mirror interface
- Voice-controlled home dashboard
- Desktop assistant for weather, alerts, and ChatGPT interaction
- Wall-mounted information panel in a hallway or entrance
- Embedded assistant in smart appliances

## Software Prerequisites

### Arduino IDE V1.8.10

[IDE Setup & Config](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)

#### Project Setup

1. Clone this repository and open `ESP32_CHAT/ESP32_CHAT.ino`.
2. Copy `ESP32_CHAT/secrets.example.h` → `ESP32_CHAT/secrets.h`
3. Edit `secrets.h` with your Wi‑Fi and API key. Optional default location values are used if IP lookup fails:
   ```cpp
   #define WIFI_SSID "YourWiFiSSID"
   #define WIFI_PASS "YourWiFiPassword"
   #define OPENAI_API_KEY "sk-..."
   #define DEFAULT_PLACE_NAME "Your City"
   #define DEFAULT_PLACE_LAT  "-33.9"
   #define DEFAULT_PLACE_LNG  "18.4"
   ```
4. Select your board and COM port in Arduino IDE, then compile and upload.

---

### Usage

- On boot the device shows the weather and updates about every 30 seconds.
- The location is automatically detected via IP geolocation to fetch local weather.
- Open Serial Monitor at 115200 baud to send ChatGPT prompts.
- Prefix prompt with `IMAGE:` to request a bitmap response.

The weather page now features animated color graphics using the ILI9488
display. A smooth gradient background and moving icons reflect real
time conditions. Touch buttons at the bottom switch between the
dashboard and ChatGPT assistant page. ChatGPT responses render with a
typing effect.

### Micro-framework

The project now exposes a small framework (see `app.*`) that maintains a
simple state machine and delegates to device modules such as display,
touch, audio and external services. This structure makes it easier to
extend the codebase with additional hardware like a microphone or
speaker.

This release now includes a minimal [LVGL](https://github.com/lvgl/lvgl)
setup (`lvgl_ui.*`) wired to the existing LovyanGFX display and touch
drivers. **LovyanGFX v1** is required and the code defines
`LGFX_USE_V1` automatically. LVGL allows creation of modern widgets such
as labels and buttons and greatly simplifies building polished user
interfaces. The
default firmware still renders using the lightweight canvas routines,
but if the LVGL library is installed in Arduino IDE the `lvgl_ui`
module will automatically create matching screens for the weather and
ChatGPT pages. A default `lv_conf.h` based on the official template is
provided under `libraries/` so LVGL builds out of the box. When the
optional [lvglCpp](https://github.com/dev-board-tech/lvglCpp) wrapper
library is installed, the UI module uses its C++ style widgets for
cleaner, modular code.
The project sets `LV_CONF_PATH` to `../../../libraries/lv_conf.h` so the
configuration is found automatically. If the Arduino build still fails
with `lv_conf.h` not found, adjust this path in `lvgl_ui.h` or copy
`libraries/lv_conf.h` next to your `lvgl` library folder.
